KWARC RDF Extractor, an extensible XSLT-based framework for extracting RDF from XML

The Krextor homepage, +formerly at https://trac.kwarc.info/krextor/+ (now broken), is currently being migrated to [[https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/krextor/wiki/][the wiki pages of this GitHub project]] (track progress at [[/EIS-Bonn/krextor/issues/1][#1]]).

A part of the old homepage that has survived is [[http://old.kwarc.info/projects/krextor/pubs.html][an old list of publications mentioning Krextor]]: our own ones, plus third-party ones.
